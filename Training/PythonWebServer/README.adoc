= Python Web Server Training

This training involves creating a simple web server that presents information from an external location. The final result should look similar to the GIF below.

This training aims to provide experience with the following:

* Python, CSS, HTML, and Javascript
* Using a Docker environment
* Responsive web design
* Creating a web server
* AJAX calls
* Using third party packages and reading their documentaiton
* Submitting a pull request for review


== Running the Boiler Plate

The program runs on Python3, but it is recommended to run this program in Docker.
Steps to install Docker are link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/[here].
On Windows operating systems less than Windows 10 Pro, you will need to use link:https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/[Docker Toolbox] instead of the default Docker installation.

Follow these steps to run the program.

. Verify that Docker is properly installed with `docker run hello-world`.

. Then build the Docker image with `./docker_build.sh init`, you will only need to run this when the `Dockerfile` changes.

. Then run the program with `./docker_build.sh run 8000`, with the last argument being whatever port you wish to run on.

. You can then connect to the web server on your a browser at http://localhost:8000.
If you are using Docker Toolbox, connect at http://192.168.99.100:8000 instead.
Change the port number to whatever port you chose in the `./docker-build.sh run <port>` command.
You should see a red "Hello world!" at the center of the browser.

== List of Changes To Complete

. Properly error check the port argument in `webserver.py`

. Create a UI that looks similar to the example.
Do not worry making an exact copy, the important parts are:
.. Gradient background that covers the whole window
.. Responsive button
.. Clearly separated information sections
.. General spacing separating various elements

. Ensure the different sections are responsive to the window size.

. Update the `Dockerfile` to install the `psutil` Python package.

. Have the server respond to a POST request with the following information:
.. The current time
.. The amount of CPUs (logical processors) and the system-wide CPU utilization as a percentage
Use `psutil` for this information
.. The amount of total and used RAM in GB to two decimal places
Use `psutil` for this information

. Send an AJAX request when the _Update_ button is pressed and update the page with the results.
Use the jQuery library that has already been included.

Once the above steps are completed, submit a pull request to this repository with all your changes.
You can refer to our link:https://github.com/StudentOrganisationForAerospaceResearch/DevelopmentResources/tree/master/Documentation/HowToPullRequest[guide] on how to submit a pull request.

The only files that need to be edited for this training are:

* `webserver.py`
* `index.html`
* `Dockerfile`
* `resources/stylesheet.css`
* `resources/index.js`
